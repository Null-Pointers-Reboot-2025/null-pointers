## ðŸ§  One-Line Summary
**Thrive** is an agentic AI-powered task manager that turns wellbeing, life goals, and financial intentions into personalised, adaptive micro-tasks â€” helping users move forward at their own pace with compassion and clarity.

## ðŸ“– Real-World Example: Ahmed's Journey

Meet Ahmed, a 26-year-old ICU nurse in Manchester working rotating night shifts. Like many young adults, Ahmed faces unique challenges in maintaining his wellbeing:

- Erratic schedule due to rotating night shifts
- Difficulty maintaining consistent routines
- Privacy concerns about health data usage
- Need for personalized support that fits his lifestyle

Most young adults feel overwhelmed trying to juggle mental health, life admin, and finances â€” with multiple apps, zero cohesion, and no clear path forward.

**Thrive** changes that.  
It's not just a to-do list â€” it's a compassionate, intelligent guide.  
Using agentic AI, Thrive learns how you're feeling, what you're facing, and where you want to go â€” then crafts a personalised plan, broken down into manageable tasks.  

By integrating wellness tools, financial advice, and life coaching into a unified task system, Thrive helps Ahmed improve wellbeing *while* staying on top of life

### How Thrive Helped Ahmed

**Personalized Task Management**

- Created pre-shift routines to help him prepare mentally and physically
- Recommended post-shift wind-down activities to improve sleep quality

**Smart Recommendations**
- Light exposure suggestions during his waking hours
- Micro-breaks designed for hospital environments
- Quick mindfulness exercises that can be done in a break room
- Nutrition tips for shift workers

## âœ… Azure Resources in Your Diagram + FinwiseOS Usage

| Azure Resource | Role in FinwiseOS |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Application Gateway + WAF | Entry point for all traffic (frontend + API); applies Web Application Firewall rules |
| App Service (Next.js frontend) | Hosts the FinwiseOS user interface (React/Next.js), deployed behind the gateway |
| App Service (Agent & App APIs) | Hosts backend APIs including agent orchestrator and smaller AI agents (FastAPI) |
| App Service integration subnet | Isolates app services in a private subnet to restrict public access |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Used to store structured data like user_state, quests, xp_logs, trust_flags |
| Azure Redis Cache | Speeds up access to session tokens, user memory fragments, and LLM prompt chains |
| Azure Key Vault | Securely stores API keys, LLM credentials, health sync tokens, OAuth secrets |
| Azure Machine Learning | Optional: Hosts custom models (e.g., for embeddings or agent-level inference) |
| Managed Online Endpoint (ML) | Endpoint for inferencing hosted ML models (e.g., prompt tuning or emotion scoring) |
| Compute Instances (private subnet) | Hosts Qdrant (vector memory), or open-source LLMs like llama.cpp if self-hosted |
| Azure Storage | Stores logs, backups, session exports, and user-submitted attachments |
| Azure AI Search | Optional: Used for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) if browsing financial content |
| Azure OpenAI Service | Handles core LLM prompts for goal parsing, tone writing, adaptive dialog |
| Azure Container Registry | Stores containerized agent images deployed via App Service or AKS |
| Log Analytics Workspace | Tracks metrics, agent errors, trust-related events, and system health logs |
| Diagnostics Settings | Sends logs from WAF, App Service, ML, and Key Vault to central monitoring |
| Managed Identity | Grants App Services and ML resources access to Key Vault without exposing credentials |
| Private Endpoints | Secure connection to Cosmos DB, Redis, Key Vault, Storage, etc. without public IPs |
| Subnets + NSGs | Segregate services into logical units (e.g. frontend, backend, data) and apply firewall rules |
| Jump Boxes / Build Agents | For secure SSH/RDP access to VMs or for CI/CD deployments (e.g., GitHub runners) |
| Hub Virtual Network | Central VNET enabling communication between workloads via peering |
| User Defined Routes (UDR) | Routes traffic from spoke to hub securely, ensuring all egress flows through firewalls |
| Spoke Virtual Network | Workload-specific subnet for FinwiseOS, peered to hub |
| Azure Firewall / DDoS Protection | Protects backend systems from unauthorized access and mitigates large-scale attacks |
| Azure Bastion | Secure remote access to private subnets (e.g. to admin Qdrant or containers) |
| Cost Management / Policy Assignments | Manages resource quotas, budget alerts, and compliance rules |
| Defender for Cloud | Monitors security posture, alerts on misconfigurations or threat signals |
| Role Assignments | Controls access to APIs, storage, and sensitive agent operations via RBAC |
