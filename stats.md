Sometimes I struggle & it kind of

gets the better of me; there's

nothing I can do to fix it or change

it too much...I lost my first job

because of it.

- P1

 

convince myself that

I'm not good enough

 

P5

 

I've got a lot of past traumas, all

kinds squeezed into 26-years...I

have gone without electricity,

food, socialising...It's difficult to

wait six months (for NHS therapy)

when you're needing help now.

 

I do a range of different things at

different points in time...I use Apps

more meticulously when things are

worse....I think over time I've gotten

better at understanding what

exercises & what tools work in these

situations & just apply them as

needed.

- P1

 

 

43% experienced stress, 42%experienced anxiety & 32% experienced feelings of loneliness / social isolation

32% have talked to a GP about mental health issues

28% reported work triggered mental health problems, while 22% needed time off work

loss/financial worries as a trigger

for past mental health problems*

 

28% of young people listed their work/ professional life as a trigger for past mental health problems*

I would definitely be more inclined

to use or switch towards that bank.

- P1

...it would give me a bit of confidence &

reassurance knowing that my bank knows my

situation.

Not just financially...they know what's going on

with me personally & how that can impact my

finances.

Just knowing that they've got my back &

knowing that they can
